Logging
=======

A vital feature for a distributed platform is a logging system that allows developers to easily
inspect and debug live deployments. RAIN provides a logging system created not only to serve the
platform's needs but also the custom needs of component developers. It's architecture is inspired
by the successful log4x library. Reasons for this choice include general programmer familiarity
with the library and a proven design. Features of RAIN's logging system include: custom component
loggers, useful appenders and layouts provided off-the-shelf, support for defining custom appenders
and layouts, complete JSON-based configuration.

--------
Overview
--------

The logging system is comprised of *loggers*, *appenders* and *layouts*. Connecting these togheter
through configuration gives developers great flexibility in specifying their output targets. Mixins
are provided that developers can use for creating custom implementations for appenders or layouts.
In addition, several implementations are provided by the platform. RAIN provides one **platform
logger** and developers have the possibility of *extending it* through a **component logger** for
their particular needs. In this way there is only one logger, but it can have an extended set of
appenders for each component.

.. note::
    Component loggers always extend the platform logger so any message logged at component level
    also gets logged at platform level.

RAIN's logging system defines 5 log levels. From the weakest to the strongest, these are:

    * ``DEBUG``
    * ``INFO``
    * ``WARN``
    * ``ERROR``
    * ``FATAL``

Here is an overview of the interfaces and classes available as part of the logging system. They will
be detailed in the following sections.

Configuration
-------------

As mentioned, configuring the logging system is possible at both the server (*server.conf.default*)
and component (*meta.json*) levels. The server configuration specifies the platform logger and
at component level developers can extend it with custom appenders and layouts available to their
component only.

Configuration is done inside the *logger* key. We will first see a complete example to get
familiar with the available options and then describe each component of the logging system in
detail. This is how a platform logger would be defined in the *server.conf.default* file::

    // ...
    logger: {
        level: 'info',
        appenders: [{
            type: 'console',
            layout: {
                type: 'pattern',
                params: {
                    'pattern': '%date %-5level %20.20logger - %message'
                }
            }
        }]
    }

The configuration specifies a platform logger that only logs messages having an *INFO* or above
level. The only appender the logger has is a *console* appender which uses a *pattern* layout.
The console appender as well as the pattern layout are provided by the platform.

Extending the platform logger for a component that needs a custom appender is easily achieved
through a similar configuration inside the component's *meta.json* file::

    // ...
    logger: {
        appenders: [{
            level: 'error',
            type: 'file',
            layout: {
                type: 'pattern',
                params: {
                    pattern: '%date - %message%newline%stacktrace'
                }
            },
            params: {
                file: 'logs/error.log'
            }
        }]
    }

This component logger configuration extends the platform logger with a *file* appender that only
logs messages having an *ERROR* level or above. The versatile pattern layout is used again, but
notice the appender *params* key. Some appenders define custom parameters such as in this case
where the log file path is specified.

An important observation is that the appenders themselves may have a level defined (as was done
with the file appender in the example above). This level acts as a threshold for that particular
appender, filtering out messages that have a lower level.

Moreover, component logger configurations aren't allowed to redefine the general logger level,
because this setting must only be configurable by the platform administrator.

.. note::
    Any appender that doesn't have a level specified will inherit the platform logger level. This
    behavior is usually not desired for custom component appenders, because it means the logging
    level may fluctuate as the platform administrator tweaks the general level setting. It is thus
    usually best to define levels for all custom component appenders.

Logging an INFO message with this example component logger will send the message to the platform
console appender, since that one inherits the level from the logger, but it will not send it to
the component file appender, since that one has a level threshold of ERROR. Naturally, logging
an ERROR or FATAL message will send it to both appenders.

.......
Loggers
.......

RAIN's logging system supports one platform logger and multiple component loggers, with only one
logger being available per component. The component loggers extend the platform logger with custom
appenders so *at any time there is only one logger visible to the running code*, be it the platform
logger for server code or a particular component logger for that component's code.

The *logger* configuration object supports the following properties:

..
    /*
        Please keep the table formatting neat and clean when updating by following these simple
        rules:

            - cells should have at least 2 spaces left and right padding
            - columns should be separated by at least 2 spaces
            - the table should be kept at full 100 chars width all the time
    */

=============  ====================================================================================
  Property      Description
=============  ====================================================================================
  level         Optional property. Log level value that will be inherited by all appenders that
                don't specify a level. Only valid for the platform logger definition.

  appenders     Optional property. Array of appenders. For component loggers, these are added to
                the list provided by the platform logger.
=============  ====================================================================================

.........
Appenders
.........

An appender defines an output target. Any number of appenders may be defined for a logger. Appender
configuration objects support the following properties:

..
    /*
        Please keep the table formatting neat and clean when updating by following the rules
        outlined before the first table above.
    */

============  =====================================================================================
  Property      Description
============  =====================================================================================
  level         Optional property. Threshold level below which messages are not logged by this
                appender. Acts as a basic filter. If not specified, it will be inherited from the
                platform logger level.

  type          Required property. One of the predefined appender types or a path to a module
                implementing the Appender interface inside the server folder of the current
                component if configuring a component logger.

  layout        Optional property. Layout configuration object for this appender.

  params        Optional property. Specific configuration parameters for this appender.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Platform Appenders
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The logging system defines a set of common appenders that can be used directly. These are summarized
in the following table:

..
    /*
        Please keep the table formatting neat and clean when updating by following the rules
        outlined before the first table above.
    */

===================  ==============================================================================
  Appender             Description
===================  ==============================================================================
  console              Logs to the standard output.
  colored-console      Logs to the standard output using configurable colors.
  file                 Logs to a file.
===================  ==============================================================================

.......
Layouts
.......

A layout describes the format of the message that is output by the appender. Only one layout
may be defined per appender. Layout configuration objects support the following properties:

..
    /*
        Please keep the table formatting neat and clean when updating by following the rules
        outlined before the first table above.
    */

============  =====================================================================================
  Property      Description
============  =====================================================================================
  type          Required property. One of the predefined layout types or a path to a module
                implementing the Layout interface inside the server folder of the current
                component if configuring a component logger.

  params        Optional property. Specific configuration parameters for this layout.
============  =====================================================================================

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Platform Layouts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The logging system defines a set of common layouts that can be used directly. These are summarized
in the following table:

..
    /*
        Please keep the table formatting neat and clean when updating by following the rules
        outlined before the first table above.
    */

===================  ==============================================================================
  Layout               Description
===================  ==============================================================================
  simple               Consists of the message level, followed by a dash and the messsage itself,
                       e.g. ``DEBUG - Module loaded``.

  pattern              Supports a comprehensive list of placeholders that can be combined to
                       assemble a message containing information exposed by the platform,
                       by the environment or by the logging event.
                       
                       Some possible placeholders are: ``%date``, ``%level``, ``%logger``,
                       ``%message``, ``%newline``, ``%exception``, ``%stacktrace``,
                       ``%session{key}``, ``%sid``, ``%request{key}``.
                       
                       Format modifiers like justification, minimum and maximum width are also
                       supported. For example, ``%-5level`` specifies right padding with spaces if
                       width is less than 5 characters, ``%20.20logger`` specifies default (left)
                       padding with spaces if logger name is shorter than 20 characters, and a
                       truncation of the name if it is larger than 20 characters.

-----------
Client Side
-----------

The logging system was built with the objective that logging should be centralized. In this regard,
client side specific appenders aren’t supported. However, client side code is as important as server
side code, so it is useful to give developers access to the logging system on the client side. The
solution is to log all messages to the server side, regardless of their origin.

RAIN should open a websocket channel for sending logging events originating on the client to the
server. The pattern layout makes it easy to separate messages from the client and server by
providing a placeholder for this use.
