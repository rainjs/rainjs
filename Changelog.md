# Changelog


## v 0.23.0

* The server configuration can be split in multiple files and the server reads all the ``.conf``
  files from the specified directory. The environment variable ``RAIN_CONF`` accepts a folder,
  not the path to the configuration files. This allows storing sensitive information in a separate
  file.

## v 0.22.0

* The partial templates feature was implemented: the ``partial`` Handlebars helper was added.
* The ``end`` callback that was passed to WebSocket handlers was removed. Now you can return a
  promise in order to delay the session save.
* The method ``context.messaging.getSocket`` changed to accept channel name as parameter. The
  old form ``/component-id/version/channel`` still works, but it isn't recommended.

## 0.20.0

* Fixed a "raind" bug: RAIN_CONF environment variable was ignored.
* Fixed an issue where calling raind from a sub-directory of the project would cause RAIN to crash.
* Fixed a bug where a socket would not be flagged as connected in client rendering and no
  components were rendered via websockets.

## 0.19.0

* Improved the CSS Renderer: now it can load more than 31 stylesheets and the loading process is
  more efficient. This change is transparent for the developers. Warning: IE8 and IE9 can't load
  more than 32000 CSS rules.
* Raintime was modified to generate static ids for the components with undefined static ids.
* The init and start methods of a client side controller can return a promise to delay the init
  and start events until the component is ready. Example: a component can wait for its children to
  load before emitting the start event.

## 0.18.0

* Client-side component dependencies can be requested using the ``js/path/file_without_extension``
  convention (example: ``js/file``, ``js/lib/file``). The previous way of requesting js files
  (``/component/optional_version/js/file.js``) still works but it's not recommended.
* Removed the ``util`` shortcut from the RequireJS paths. In order to use the ``util`` library you
  should request it using ``raintime/lib/util``.
* Fixed a bug where a component added to the page using ``context.insert`` could not be found.

* Nested components are now fully supported, it is now possible to define child content for tags that is correctly
  resolved.

  like tag libraries.

* Many improvements in the supplied example components.
