# What is it?

   * RAIN is a highly scalable frontend platform that orchestrates distributed rendering of loosely coupled components.
   * By using standard web technologies (HTML 5, CSS 3) RAIN enables developers to create a stunning user experience on modern browsers and next generation devices (tablets, smart phones).
   * Thus RAIN enables developers to focus on their core competence by providing simple feature reusage and tooling.

   * Non expensive hardware required
   * Fast asynchronous distributed rendering
   * Web intents for feature reusage (lazy binding at runtime)
   * Independent releases of components
   * I18N on server and client side (includes layout localization as well)
   * Independent themes releases

# Getting started

As developer is really easy to get started with RAIN development. RAIN can be used under each major
operating system without performance penalties. The recommended way is to use rain sdk for accessing
RAIN features.
Please read [Getting started](http://rainjs.github.com/rainjs/getting_started/installation.html "Getting started guide")
